Two General Rules The blog1 mentioned that there are two general rules of thumb with containers: unless otherwise restricted and capped, a container gets access to all the CPU and memory capacity available on... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>[AWS][ECS] Difference between storage_stats and blkio_stats from ECS metadata endpoint</title><link href="https://shihtiy.com/posts/Difference-storage_states-and-blkio_stats/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[AWS][ECS] Difference between storage_stats and blkio_stats from ECS metadata endpoint" /><published>2022-04-19T00:30:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-05-11T21:34:11+01:00</updated> <id>https://shihtiy.com/posts/Difference-storage_states-and-blkio_stats/</id> <content src="https://shihtiy.com/posts/Difference-storage_states-and-blkio_stats/" /> <author> <name>Shih-Ting, Yuan</name> </author> <category term="CSIE" /> <category term="Cloud" /> <category term="AWS" /> <summary> Introduction / Summary This article will go though a brief explanation that why storage_stats and blkio_stats have different output from ECS metadata endpoint. Scenario Some people will question that why the field storage_stats is empty from ECS task metadata while blkio_stats has metrics. People expect that the field storage_stats should provide some metrics about storage.

Scenario Sometimes people want to know how to calculate the performance usages of the containers. They can use sidecar container to retrieve the data from the metrics provided by the ECS metadata endpoint. Thus they can collect, calculate and export the perf... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>[AWS][CLB] Which AZ will CLB scale?</title><link href="https://shihtiy.com/posts/CLB-Scaling-in-AZ/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[AWS][CLB] Which AZ will CLB scale?" /><published>2022-01-02T17:20:24+00:00</published> <updated>2022-05-11T21:34:11+01:00</updated> <id>https://shihtiy.com/posts/CLB-Scaling-in-AZ/</id> <content src="https://shihtiy.com/posts/CLB-Scaling-in-AZ/" /> <author> <name>Shih-Ting, Yuan</name> </author> <category term="CSIE" /> <category term="Cloud" /> <category term="AWS" /> <summary> Introduction When under the following conditions: CLB enables multiple AZs. Cross-zone load balancing is disabled. Healthy backend instances only locate in one of the AZs. CLB DNS only register the IPs of the AZ where the healthy backend instance locate.1 Therefore, some people may wonder CLB will scale: All enabled AZ? AZ with backends? Or AZ with healthy backends?
