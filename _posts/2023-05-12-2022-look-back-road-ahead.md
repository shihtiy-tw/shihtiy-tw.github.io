## Introduction

Over the past year, my role and responsibilities as an AWS Cloud Support Engineer has significantly expanded. Apart from handling daily cases, I've been focused on enhancing AWS Knowledge Center content, acquiring Amazon ECS Subject Matter Expertise (SME), and progressing towards a promotion.

## AWS Knowledge Center

A major part of my efforts has been dedicated to developing informative articles for the AWS Knowledge Center. I focus on topics related to Amazon ECS, addressing task container health check failures and Application Load Balancer health checks.  You can find these articles here:

- [How do I troubleshoot the container health check failures for Amazon ECS tasks?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/ecs-task-container-health-check-failures)

- [How can I get my Amazon ECS tasks running using the Amazon EC2 launch type to pass the Application Load Balancer health check in Amazon ECS?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/troubleshoot-unhealthy-checks-ecs)

## AWS Youtube Videos

Additionally, I created and published a series of how-to videos, demonstrating the process of mounting an Amazon EFS file system on an Amazon ECS container or task running on Fargate, and changing the status of Amazon EKS nodes from NotReady/Unknown status to Ready status. These videos provide visual, step-by-step guides to help users resolve their problems effectively:

## Subject Matter Expert (SME) in Container Service (ECS)

One of my proudest achievements in the past year has been acquiring Subject Matter Expertise (SME) in Amazon ECS. This accomplishment, stemming from hands-on experience and continuous learning, has greatly enhanced my troubleshooting abilities and understanding of ECS applications.

## Promotion to Cloud Support Engineer II

Parallel to these projects, I've achieved the position of AWS Cloud Support Engineer II. This has broadened my view of AWS operations and enhanced my leadership skills.

## What's next

Moving forward, I aim to delve deeper into cases during my daily operations, lead more projects, and share my AWS experiences and insights through this blog. I look forward to exploring and discussing the latest trends in cloud computing, especially those related to Amazon ECS.
